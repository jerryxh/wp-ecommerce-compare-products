Add a World Class Compare Products Feature to your WP e-Commerce store today with the WP e-Commerce Compare Products plugin.

== Description ==

The Compare Products extension for WP e-Commerce gives a product comparison feature that you'd only expect to find on the big corporate e-commerce sites. 

Compare Products uses your existing WP e-Commerce Product Categories and Product Variations to create Product Feature Sets that can be assigned to each and every product to create a feature comparison table. 

This allows users to firstly add products to a compare widget basket, then at the click of a mouse the chosen products can be viewed in a state-of-the-art comparison table. 

Chosen products are compared side-by-side, feature by feature, price-by-price. Discard products from the table at the click of a mose as you hone in on the product that is the one for you. Save the comparison as a PDF or print it.

= Why We Built it! =

We love the Compare Products feature that the big e-commerce sites have. We have looked at them all and over 12 months have developed what we believe is a product comparison extension for WP e-Commerce that is better than any of them.

We distribute the plugin in 2 versions - This FREE lite version and an advanced featured Pro Version.  Today thousands of WP e-Commerce stores owners successfully use the Free lite version to provide the Product Comparison feature we love - to their customers.

= Support =

If you have any problem with setting up the Free lite version please post your support request here on the WordPress support forum. PLEASE if you have a problem DO NOT just give the plugin a bad star rating and review without first requesting support. Giving the plugin a bagging without affording us the opportunity to help solve the issue is in our opinion just incredibly unfair.

Once you have the plugin installed and activated please refer to the plugins comprehensive [Online Documentation](http://docs.a3rev.com/user-guides/wp-e-commerce/wpec-compare-products/) and guide to setting up the Compare Products plugin on your WP e-Commerce store.If you have questions - agin please post them to the support forum here.

* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9.

Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly.
