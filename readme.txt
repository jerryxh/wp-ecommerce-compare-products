== Description ==


WP eCommerce Compare Products is designed to give shoppers on your site the ultimate in shopping comparison features to make choosing and buying a product from your offering a breeze.

WP eCommerce Compare Products adds a product Comparison feature to any or all products on your WPEC site. Site users click a button or a link to add products to their compare list in the sidebar widget area.

From the pop up screen they can add products to their shpping cart, print the results or return to the product page and continue to add other products.
